        Police brutality cases are rising in Africa, and citizens are outraged and feel abandoned.
        Police brutality has become a hot topic globally, with activists and organizations regularly
        staging demonstrations. In some African countries, the violence meted out by security officers
        worsened after governments imposed curfews to contain the spread of COVID-19.
        Some researchers have highlighted that it is essential to recognize how the policing and
        prison systems are inherently oppressive.
        However, citizens’ technology usage has seen a greater level of democratization, enabling
        the citizens to be more connected to the government and international institutions.
        Although technology usage presents an opportunity for transformation for better connectedness,
        less corruption, and a stable society, it is still used as an “instrument to oppress
        people.”
        According to the researcher Benjamin Smith, it
        is common to assume that these institutions
        are instruments to keep society safe and enable
        citizens’ freedom. This common assumption
        ignores the police and prison system’s historical
        tendency to suppress social movements and
        tightly manage poor and non-white people’s
        behavior. The Marxist theory supports the idea
        that police is an apparatus of capitalist exploitation,
        praying on the economic vulnerabilities
        and increased inequality.


        The Marxist theory conceives police and prison
        systems as a “repressive apparatus”. The
        theory assumes that the state is a machinery of
        repression, which has enabled the ruling class
        to ensure their domination over the working
        class, thus allowing the former to subject the
        latter to the process of surplus-value exploitation,
        which is also known as capitalist exploitation.
