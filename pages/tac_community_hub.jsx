        In the Internet age of the 21st century, it would be simply naïve for Law Enforcement Agencies to depend solely on traditional means of community engagement.
        While important, having a physical presence in the community is no longer sufficient to combat crime on it’s own.

        Social media allows for Law Enforcement Agencies to be the direct source of news to the public, particularly during times of emergency. Evident in the Boston Marathon bombings that took place in April 2013,

        Twitter was used to keep the public updated as it unfolded, the status of the investigation and the steps the police took to manage the crisis. This greatly reduced misinformation.
