          The changing nature of crime has long been
          an important aspect and challenge for the law
          enforcement agencies to fight against the
          above phenomenon. This is evermore the
          case in this modern era characterized by data,
          the Internet and new technologies. As a
          result, law enforcement agencies world-wide
          are increasingly being tasked with combating
          a mix of both entirely new forms of crime and
          traditional crimes that are carried out in new
          and innovative ways.
          At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies offer unique means to
          support law enforcement in solving such problems. Due to the increased capacity to analyze
          large amounts of data, AI may be a powerful tool to enhance the effectiveness of law enforcement
          agenciesâ€™ daily operations, as well as optimizing public resources through, for instance,
          crime hotspot analytics, forecasting where and what type of crimes are likely to occur.
          The United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI), through its
          Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, and Technology Against Crime (TAC) Africa
          have partnered in order to explore the challenges that African law enforcement agencies may
          face and to better understand how AI-related technologies can provide assistance.
          Through this virtual technical workshop, UNICRI and TAC Africa, in collaboration with key
          representatives from African countries, seek to explore, new and emerging threats associated
          with AI and crime, as well as the role or possible role of AI in crime prevention in Africa and
          the state of AI-readiness of law enforcement communities in Africa.
          Additionally, the workshop will seek to build a local community in the region in terms of
        ` AI and crime prevention. This network will also serve to facilitate engagement of representatives
          from the region in the Third INTERPOL-UNICRI Global Meeting on AI for Law
          Enforcement to be held virtually in November. The Global Meeting will have a specific
          regional component, which will include Africa, Latin America, Central Asia, and South
          and South East Asia.
          As the meeting was held virtually, there was no limit on participation, although in the
          interests of fostering an active discussion a smaller group is to be preferred. The number
          of participants were 200+.
          A reliable information exchange network and feedback mechanism on AI for Law Enforcement
          in Africa between UNICRI and TAC Africa; and Actionable suggestions and follow-
          up priorities from participants was envisioned.`
