        Nigeria is the most populous and largest economy in Africa. Agriculture is its economic
        base and source of livelihood for the majority of Nigerians, employing two-thirds of the
        labour-force with 88% smallholder farmers, 72% living below the poverty-line and
        70–80% of smallholder labour-force women. Nigeria is listed by DAC as an ODA Recipient.
        Challenges for smallholder farmers are numerous, including constraints to land access;
        obsolete production methodology; supply chain inefficiencies; corruption; informal markets
        (100%), cash-economics and non-existent global- trade keeping productivity low and
        waste high. The government, FAO, UNDP, CBN and WEF concur constraints include poor
        access to credit {'\<7%' } and adoption of technologies.
        {'<6%'} of farmers benefit from extension services from knowledge and information transfer,
        compounded by the decision-making power disproportionately being held by men
        and women ownership at {'<13%.'} Women smallholders account for 70% of food production
        and their lack of autonomous decision-making and agency stifles improvements from
        knowledge-intensive agriculture.
        This research’s primary purpose is to enable autonomous decision-making for smallholder
        farmers in Nigeria, so they have equitable access to opportunities from frontier technology
        and financial ecosystems with increased digital skills to participate in global B2B trade
        and final stage distribution.
        Authenticated data assists the agricultural sector’s efficiency and enable services in related
        sectors such as insure Tech, EdTech, and Government Technology services. The availability
        of datasets to third-parties accelerates innovation, creates new revenue sources
        from the digital-economy and promotes indirect job creation of 15% (IMF).
        This underpins economic development for Nigeria with growth of at least 1% in GDP, improved
        and sustained incomes, and positive impact on food-security and better nutrition.
        Our research directly addresses the required data to enable decision-making from a farm
        to trade and beyond perspective.
