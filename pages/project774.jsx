            Technology Against Crime (TAC) Africa is an NGO, that is wholly committed to developing Africa’s Economic
            and Security space through Digital Specialized Skills and Capacity building for Academia, Law Enforcement
            Agencies, Government Organizations and individuals by serving as a catalyst through which Emerging
            Technological Solutions could be thought in a structured and easy to learn methodology.
              <div className='my-8 ' > 
              TAC Africa was born out of an International Forum on Technologies, with a high-level dedication towards the
                adoption of “Technology for a safer world. Essentially, we are a non-governmental, bipartisan organization, that
                connects law enforcement, subject matter experts, and civil society to solve issues that affect our society. We work
                on the transformation of our law enforcement and judiciary, making them more technologically enabled. Besides
                this, we solve problems through policy advocacy, research, training and capacity building and volunteering.

              Project 774 is an ongoing initiative of the Technology Against Crime Africa NGO. It is a project initiated to help
                curb the security challenges and drive the growth of the Digital Economy in Africa through a community-based
                approach (Community-centered Digital Hub) to promote digital engagement.

              The vision of Project 774 is to create an integrated Digital inclusive Society that improves the quality of life of
                Nigerian citizens in remote communities in the 774 local government areas (LGAs) to drive the growth of the
                Digital Economy in Nigeria through a community-based approach

              The long-term aim of Project 774 is not just to catch up with urban areas and bridge the digital divide, but also to
                build partnerships with cities and rural communities. This can encourage rural areas to progress through the
                various stages of a genuine digital transformation – from digital isolation to connection and to become digital
                players in their own right.
