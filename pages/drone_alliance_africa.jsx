            Drone Alliance Africa (DAA) is a coalition of leading technology companies representing
            the commercial drone industry before African political leaders, regulators, and other
            industry stakeholders, as well as international regulatory and advisory bodies. The commercial
            drone industry has the potential to bring tremendous economic growth, jobs,
            innovation, and broad societal benefits. Amid exponential industry growth and opportunity,
            it is critical to pursue a forward-leaning regulatory framework to fully realize this potential
            and further promote African leadership in research, production, and application of
            this technology.
