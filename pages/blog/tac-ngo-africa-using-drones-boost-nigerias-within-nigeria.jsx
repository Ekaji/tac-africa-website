He is a Drone Expert, maritime survey Expert and an Intelligence System Support specialist trained by INTERPOL and FBI. Being active in the Law Enforcement Domain for over a decade now, he uses Innovative Aerial Surveillance & remote sensing to tackle the unique set of challenges the region is facing including on the one side, crimes like oil theft and on the other, battling insurgents and terrorist group, often operating in very remote locations.</p>

            He believes the major problem of Africa is unavailability of robust internet infrastructure, satellite unavailability and unconnected innovative solution to curb the technology menace bedeviling the Sub region.
            <br/>

            It is in the light of this and other considerations that the NGO Technology Against Crime Africa was created to bring together an international platform to tackle this menace by connecting to other part of the world.
            <br/>

            <p>CEO/Founder TAC Africa NGO is part and parcel of the Law Enforcement domain as evident in his letters of recommendation and numerous accolades, just to mention a few.</p>

            <h3 className="font-bold font-sans break-normal text-gray-900 pt-8 pb-2 text-xl md:text-2xl">
            To this end, Technology Against Crime, NGO Africa is in dire need of setting up a very viable international network of experts that will be part of the Scientific Committee to determine how drone can take its place in fighting crime while preserving rights.
              <br/>
            We by this publication extend our hands of partnership to academia, subject matter experts, industry leaders, original equipment manufacturers and law enforcement agents to join the forces with TAC NGO Africa through active partnership, collaboration and integration.
            <br/>

            Furthermore, at TAC NGO Africa we know that combatting 21st Centry crimes requires the use of modern weapons, i.e. drones, satellite, AI, big data and other emerging technologies. It is in this field that we are working on the active partnership.
